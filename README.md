##### Build files  
  
This is a collection of files, scripts, and what not that I use to build
programs I develop.  If my VirtualBox ever dies, it won't be too difficult to get going again.

#### Programs

Programs currently listed:  

* [ClamTk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk)
* [clamtk-gnome](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk-gnome)
* [clamtk-kde](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk-kde)
* [thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/thunar-sendto-clamtk)
* [nemo-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/nemo-sendto-clamtk)
