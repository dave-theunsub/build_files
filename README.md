### Build files  
  
This is a collection of files, scripts, and what not that I use to build binaries (e.g., rpms, debs, ...) of the 
programs I develop.  If my VirtualBox ever dies, it won't be too difficult to get going again.

#### Programs

Programs currently listed:  

* [ClamTk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk)
* [clamtk-gnome](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk-gnome)
* [clamtk-kde](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk-kde)
* [thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/thunar-sendto-clamtk)
* [nemo-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/nemo-sendto-clamtk)
* [xkcd-generate](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/xkcd-generate)
* [thunar-sendto-shredder](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/thunar-sendto-shredder)
* clamtk-gtk3 (not really used yet)  
  
#### Distributions  
  
I currently build binaries for Fedora, CentOS 6, CentOS 7, and Debian/Ubuntu.  One of these days I'll learn some other distributions.

#### Contact

Feel free to contact me for suggestions, comments, criticisms, etc.

##### TODO  
  
* Add actual commandline commands used with these scripts.
* Other stuff.
