### Build files  
  
This is a collection of files, scripts, and what not that I use to build binaries (e.g., rpms, debs, ...) of the programs I develop.  If my VirtualBox builds ever die, it won't be too difficult to get going again. 
   
#### Programs

Programs currently listed:  

* [clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk)
* [clamtk-gnome](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk-gnome)
* [clamtk-kde](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk-kde)
* [thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/thunar-sendto-clamtk)
* [nemo-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/nemo-sendto-clamtk)
* [xkcd-generate](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/xkcd-generate)
* [thunar-sendto-shredder](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/thunar-sendto-shredder)
  
#### Distributions  
  
I currently build binaries for Fedora, CentOS 7/8/9, and Ubuntu.  One of these days I'll learn some other distributions. Note that I cannot build much if anything for RHEL/CentOS 9 because it lacks some dependencies.
